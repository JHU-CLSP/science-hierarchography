In approach 1, we start with about 2190 papers and generate summary for each in summary_topics.py file and cluster them into 438 (2190/5) papers and keep going until we have 17 clusters. 
2190 -> 438 -> 87 -> 17

Run each of the files in sequence starting with summary_topics.py.
At various intervals, the embeddings will be stored into the embeddings folder.
The results for each of the round of clustering will be stored under results folder.
