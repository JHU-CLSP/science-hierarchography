You are a scientific domain expert. You have an initial “seed taxonomy” of scientific concepts and a list of new topics to integrate into that taxonomy...

1. You must retain the current structure of the seed taxonomy and respect all existing categories.
2. Place each and every topic from the list given below.
2. You are free to add new branches or subcategories only where necessary to fit the new topics in a consistent, hierarchical (“is-a”) manner.
3. Each topic from the list must appear exactly once. Do not introduce any new topics beyond those in the list.
4. Ensure each new topic is placed under the correct parent concept based on its semantic meaning or specialization level.
5. Return your updated taxonomy as valid JSON, containing both the original seed hierarchy and the newly incorporated topics.

Below is your seed taxonomy (in JSON). Make sure to preserve its structure:
{seed_taxonomy}

Here is the list of new topics that must be integrated:
{topics_chunk}

Focus on logical placement of each term to maintain an accurate scientific hierarchy.
