The centralized scheme allows base stations to adaptively allocate resources by learning device-specific characteristics, whereas the distributed scheme empowers IoT devices to manage resource sharing autonomously with limited information. Both methods aim to enhance timeliness and freshness of information delivery across large-scale, resource-constrained IoT environments, with the centralized approach generally outperforming the distributed one, though the latter remains more scalable for massive IoT deployments."

Results demonstrated that binary and multi-class SVMs could classify EEGs significantly better than chance, highlighting delta-band power changes in frontal regions as crucial for classification.

It highlights alterations in EEG spectral power with varying levels of hypoxia, noting increased alpha activity during moderate hypoxia and increased delta and theta activities during severe hypoxia. However, cognitive load during hypoxia seems to obscure these changes. Other quantitative EEG analysis techniques show variable responses under hypoxic conditions, indicating a need for further research to clearly define the hypoxia-EEG response curve."

High-Pt cells show full voltage recovery after NO2 removal, while low-Pt cells only partially recover.
